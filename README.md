These are the practise questions i had encountered will update daily the questions and approches
1) Problem Statement
A positive integer 
x is called a 321-like Number when it satisfies the following condition.

The digits of 
x are strictly decreasing from top to bottom.
In other words, if 
x has 
d digits, it satisfies the following for every integer 
i such that 
1≤i<d:
(the 
i-th digit from the top of 
x) 
> (the 
(i+1)-th digit from the top of 
x).
Note that all one-digit positive integers are 321-like Numbers.

For example, 
321, 
96410, and 
1 are 321-like Numbers, but 
123, 
2109, and 
86411 are not.

You are given 
N as input. Print Yes if 
N is a 321-like Number, and No otherwise.

Constraints
All input values are integers.
1≤N≤99999
